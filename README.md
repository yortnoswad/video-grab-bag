Video Grab Bag
Create security videos from a grab bag of cameras

Video Grab Bag is at the same time a little more and a little less than your average security video program.

It does 5 things
1 - Every 10 seconds or so grab a full sized picture for a webcam, and stores it.
2 - shrink that picture, and stores it
3 - Generates and hourly video from the pictures
4 - Generates a daily video from the pictures
5 - Uploads the hourly and daily video to an offsite area.

It does not do motion sensing, or send alerts, or anything fancy like that.
BUT, if you see something on your video's, that you want the full sized picture of, then you've got it.
